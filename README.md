<h1>Machine Learning in .NET</h1>
Machine Learning and everything else that falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (Deep Learning, CNN, NLP, etc.) addresses application of two main scenarios: prediction and classification. 
<h2>The Pipeline and the Chain of Estimators</h2>
The ML.NET training infrastructure is centered on three pillars: data views,
transformers, and estimators. A dedicated interface describes the core
capabilities of each component: IDataView, ITransformer, and IEstimator.
